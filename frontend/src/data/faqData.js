          title: "What makes Elan Cotts fabric premium?",
          text:
            "Elan Cotts garments are crafted using extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton. These longer fibers produce a smoother surface, enhanced softness, greater strength, and superior resistance to pilling compared to standard cotton.",
        },
        {
          title: "Does Elan Cotts cotton shrink?",
          text:
            "Due to high-density weaving, shrinkage is minimal. As cotton is a natural fiber, slight shrinkage of approximately 1–2% may occur if washed in hot water. Washing in cold water helps maintain original sizing.",

          title: "Is Elan Cotts cotton suitable for sensitive skin?",
          text:
            "Yes. The smooth fiber structure of extra-long-staple cotton reduces friction against the skin, making it ideal for individuals with sensitive or irritation-prone skin.",

          title: "Can I use fabric softener?",
          text:
            "We recommend avoiding heavy fabric softeners. Our cotton is naturally soft, and chemical softeners can coat fibers, reducing breathability and moisture-wicking performance over time.",

          title: "How do I prevent colors from fading?",
